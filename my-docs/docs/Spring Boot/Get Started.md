# Programming Languages Vs Technologies Vs Frameworks

In Java domain there are 3 subjects to learn as 3 courses:

1. **Java Language** → Core Java course
2. **Java Technologies** → Advanced Java course
3. **Java Frameworks** → SPBMS course (Spring Boot & Microservices)

---

## a) Programming Languages (These are like rice / wheat granules)

These are directly installable software acting as raw materials of application development providing basic facilities.

* Provide 10% readymade facilities; 90% developed by programmer
* Define syntax (rules) and semantics (structure of programming)
* Include compilers and interpreters
* Base for software technologies, frameworks, operating systems, DB software, tools etc.

**Examples:** java, C#, vc++, python, javascript, ada, smalltalk, etc.

### JVM Based Languages

Languages that have their own syntax and compilers but use the **common JVM** to execute are called **JVM based languages**.

**Examples:** java, scala, kotlin, groovy, go, etc.

```
.java    ----compiler---->   .class  --------------------\
                                                   |
.scala   ----compiler---->   .class  --------------------|
                                                   |---->  JVM
.groovy  ----compiler---->   .class  --------------------|
                                                   |
.go      ----compiler---->   .class  --------------------/
```
