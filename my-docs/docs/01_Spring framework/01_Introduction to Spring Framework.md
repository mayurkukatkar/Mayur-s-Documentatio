# Introduction to Framework
*(These are called fully finished products of programming like Maggi noodles or Baba noodles)*

### âœ… Definition 1
A **Framework** is a special software that is built on the top of one or more technologies having the ability to generate the common logic of the application dynamically and makes the programmers write only application-specific logic.

### âœ… Definition 2  
A **Framework** is a special software that provides abstraction on one or more technologies to simplify the application development process.

---

### ðŸ”¹ What is Abstraction?
- Abstraction means **hiding the unnecessary details and highlighting the necessary details**.
- Every framework internally uses one or more technologies to generate the **common logic of the application**, but it does not let the programmer know about it â€“ this abstraction makes development easier.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Key Points
- Frameworks are **built on top of technologies**  
- Technologies are **built on top of languages**

### ðŸ”§ Example Architecture

### ðŸ’¡ Note
- **Spring Boot = Spring++** (an enhanced version of the Spring Framework)
- Frameworks simplify development by providing **ready-to-use architecture** and **pre-built modules**.
